# Professional Web Portfolio

## This is the first iteration of building a web-based portfolio in order to showcase current status of competency in full-stack web coding. I learned how to better structure the index.html file using <body>, <header>, <nav>, <aside>, <main>, and <section> elements.

# Installation

    1. Create a GitHub repo
    2. Clone the repo to your local machine
